# Vertex-wise triangle counting
This project is implemented as a part of a homework exercise for [050] - Parallel & 
Distributed Systems course of ECE Department, AUTh. 

This has implementations written in C and C++ for detecting and counting triangles in 
K3 graphs. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. CMake
2. Make
3. g++


### Instructions
1.  Clone the repository
    ```shel
    $ git clone git@github.com:pkarakal/vertexwise-triangle-counting.git
    ```
2.  Go to that directory
    ```shell script
    $ cd vertexwise-triangle-counting/
    ```
3.  Generate Makefiles from the CMakefiles.txt
    ```shell script
    $ cmake -S .
    ```
4.  Build and run the application
    ```shell script
